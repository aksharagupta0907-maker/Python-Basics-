        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        " - Python ia a high-level, general-puprpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it popular for a wide range of application including web development, data science, and automation. Python's popularity stems from its clear syntax, extensatility across various domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        " - An interpreter is a program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them to be pre-compiled into machine language.\n",
        " in python, the interpreter reads and runs the code line by line, which facilitates easier debugging and portability across different operating systems.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords (or reserved words) are special words that have a fixed meaning and purpose in Python, and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable name, function names, ets.).\n",
        "  Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, import, True, False, and None.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        " - No. keyword cannot be used be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        " - Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        " - Lists are designed to be dynamic collections where elements can be added, removed, or change efficiently after creation, whilw tuples are designed to be static, fixed collections used for dat that should not change during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        " - The == operator checks for value equality (if two objects have the same value), while the is operator checks for identity equality (if two objects are actually the exact same object in memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        " - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.\n",
        " The there logical operators in Python are:\n",
        "   - and : Returns True if both statements are true.\n",
        "   - or : Returns True if at least one of the statements is true.\n",
        "   - not : reverses the result, returns False if the result is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "  - Type casting is the process of coverting a variable from one data type to another (e.g., converting a string \"10\" into an integer 10).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit: Python automatically converts one type to anther (e.g., adding an int to a float results in a float to avoid data loss).\n",
        "  - Explicit: The programmer manually converts the type using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - They allow the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The elif allows you to check multiple expression. if the first if condition is false, it checks the elif. if that is also fslse, it moves to the next one or the else block.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        " - For loop : Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list or range). You usually know how many times it will run,\n",
        " - while loops : Runs as long as a condition remains true. You might not know exactly how many iterations it will take.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        " - A while loop is better when the number of iterations depends on a dynamic condition, such as:\n",
        " - Reading a file until the end is reached.\n",
        " - A \"game loop\" that runs until the player hits \"Quit.\"\n",
        " - Waiting for a specific user input."
